# Jjob - Fullstack Job Portal

Jjob is a comprehensive job portal built using modern technologies like React JS, Tailwind CSS, Supabase, Clerk, and Shadcn UI. It provides a seamless experience for both candidates and recruiters, with robust authentication, job search, and management functionalities.

## FEARURES
### Authentication (Clerk Integration)

**Login/Signup**: Secure authentication powered by Clerk.  
**Dual Roles**: Users can sign up as either a Candidate or a Recruiter, or switch between roles when required.

### Candidate Features
**View Job Postings**: Browse through available jobs posted by recruiters.  
**Search Jobs**: Easily search jobs by company name and state using the advanced search functionality.  
**Apply to Jobs**: Apply for any job and track application status in the My Jobs section.  
**Saved Jobs**: Save jobs for later and access them from the Saved Jobs section.  

### Recruiter Features
**Post a Job**: Recruiters can post job openings, making them visible to candidates.  
**Apply as Candidate**: Recruiters can also apply for jobs posted by other recruiters if needed, offering flexibility to switch roles.

### Unified Role System
A user can act as both a candidate and a recruiter depending on their needs, providing a seamless transition between roles.

## Technologies Used
**React JS**:  
A powerful JavaScript library used for building user interfaces. In Jjob, React JS handles the core of the frontend, allowing the creation of reusable components and efficient rendering of the job listings, applications, and other interactive features. React’s component-based architecture ensures a scalable and maintainable structure.  

**Tailwind CSS**: 
A utility-first CSS framework that makes styling faster and more intuitive. Tailwind CSS allows you to apply classes directly to elements, leading to quick customizations without the need for writing custom CSS. For Jjob, this results in a responsive, mobile-friendly design with a sleek, modern look.  

**Supabase**: 
An open-source backend-as-a-service (BaaS) platform used to manage databases, authentication, and APIs. Supabase provides the backend infrastructure for storing job postings, applications, user roles, and job-related data. With Supabase’s real-time features, any updates to job postings or candidate applications are reflected instantly. 

**Clerk**: 
A complete user management and authentication service that simplifies handling signups, logins, and user sessions. Clerk is integrated into Jjob to ensure secure user authentication, allowing seamless role management for both candidates and recruiters. It provides features like passwordless login, two-factor authentication (2FA), and social sign-ins for added flexibility. 

**Shadcn UI**: 
A collection of pre-built, customizable UI components that help in creating a consistent user interface across the app. Shadcn UI enables Jjob to have a clean and minimalistic design while maintaining flexibility in terms of customizing components like buttons, forms, and modal dialogs to match the overall branding and design aesthetics of the portal.
